# Code for Multi-Measure Curriculum Learning for Learning on Heterogeneous Graphs (MDCL)

We adapted open source code from [HGB Benchmark](https://github.com/THUDM/HGB), and implement MDCL on it.


## Running procedure

* Dataset will be downloaded automatically at ~/.dgl/.
* or you can download data from HGB provided link: (https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/8b9644cfa8344f26878c/)
* unzip all zip files
* move them to ./data/
* run python file according to the Read.me in each model's folder

You could download pre-compute datasets' metapath or difficulty from (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TAk0z4TiczV83zfsw3FG4Ze72hXg3uEp/view?usp=drive_link) for a quicker experiment, and save it in your GNN folder.
